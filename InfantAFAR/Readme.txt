This code uses 2D normalized face videos (e.g. output of FETA, which is run with the following parameters):
	- Resolution: 224
	- Interocular distance = 80

You can run the code on a sample video (sample_video.mp4) of size (224 x 224 x 3)

Probabilities of 4 AUs are saved to the file named sample_video_results.mat

These AUs are: AU4, AU6, AU12, and AU20.
