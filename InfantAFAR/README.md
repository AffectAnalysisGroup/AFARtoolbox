# Infant AFAR: Automated Facial Action Recognition in Infants

To train and test AU detectors for infant faces, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) in adult video databases and fine-tuned these networks in two large, manually annotated, infant video databases that differ in context, head pose, illumination, video resolution, and infant age. Infant AFAR detects the following facial action units (AUs): AU1, AU2, AU3, AU4, AU6, AU9, AU12, AU20, and AU28.
